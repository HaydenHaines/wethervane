# Project: US Political Covariation Model (working name: **Bedrock**)

A political modeling platform that discovers electoral communities directly from spatially correlated shift patterns, estimates how those communities covary, and propagates polling signals through the covariance structure to produce forward predictions. Target domain: `bedrock.vote`. Public-facing; 538-style audience.

**Core insight:** beneath the noise of individual elections is a structural landscape of communities that move together politically. Those communities cross administrative boundaries, persist across decades, and can be discovered purely from how places shift. Understanding this structure — not just the surface results — is what makes prediction defensible.

**Governing principles (2026-03-19, supersedes MVP-era "minimize complexity"):**
- Build it right, not fast. Use the correct model even if it takes longer.
- Build it expandable. Every component has a clear interface.
- Two layers: **communities** (geographic blobs, HAC) + **types** (abstract archetypes, NMF). A community in rural Georgia and one in rural Washington are different communities; they may be the same type.
- K is the hardest problem. Selection must be principled (holdout accuracy), not heuristic.
- The public question is: *What will happen in 2026?*

See `docs/ROADMAP.md` for the full path forward.

## Architecture

Type-primary electoral model (ADR-006, supersedes community-primary HAC approach):

**Primary layer — Electoral types** (KMeans on county shift vectors)
Abstract archetypes discovered directly from how counties shift electorally. Each county gets soft membership across J=20 types. Types are the primary predictive engine: covariance estimation, poll propagation, and prediction all flow through type structure. Types nest hierarchically into 6-8 super-types for public communication. Asymmetric type sizes are expected (a "Rural Conservative" type may span 40% of counties; an "Asian Professional" type may cover 2%).

**Secondary layer — Geographic communities** (HAC, deferred to tract phase)
Spatially contiguous clusters of tracts for spatial smoothing. Not used in the county-level model. Will become relevant when tract-level data enables sub-county resolution.

**Full pipeline:**
1. **Data Assembly** -- Historical election returns (presidential 2000-2024, governor 2002-2022, Senate 2002-2022), Decennial Census (2000/2010/2020) with interpolation, ACS 2022, RCMS, IRS migration, FEC donor density
2. **Shift Vector Computation** -- 51 training + 3 holdout log-odds shift dimensions across all election pairs. Total vote share denominator. 293 FL+GA+AL counties.
3. **Type Discovery** -- KMeans clustering on 293 × 33 county shift matrix (2008+, presidential×2.5 weighted) → J=20 types. Each county gets soft membership vector (inverse-distance to centroids, row-normalized to sum to 1).
4. **Hierarchical Nesting** -- Ward HAC on type loadings (no spatial constraint) → 5-8 super-types for interpretability.
5. **Type Description** -- Time-matched demographics (interpolated census), RCMS, IRS migration, FEC donor density overlaid on discovered types. Types named from demographic + behavioral character.
6. **Type Covariance Construction** -- Economist-inspired: Pearson correlation from type demographic profiles → shrink toward all-1s (national swing) → validate against observed historical comovement. Hybrid fallback if validation fails.
7. **Poll Propagation** -- Gaussian Bayesian update distributes state-level poll signal to types via type covariance Σ.
8. **Prediction** -- Type-level estimates × county membership weights → county predictions. Dual output: vote share + turnout.
9. **Validation** -- Leave-one-pair-out CV, type coherence, type stability across time windows, covariance validation, calibration.

**Historical approaches (shelved, retained for comparison):**
- HAC community-primary (K=10, ADR-005): retained as `county_baseline` in model versioning
- NMF-on-demographics (K=7): original two-stage approach, R²~0.66

**Separate silo: Political Sabermetrics** -- Advanced analytics for politician performance. Shares data infrastructure with the shift discovery pipeline but has its own compute pipeline. Decomposes election outcomes into district baseline + national environment + candidate effect. See `docs/SABERMETRICS_ARCHITECTURE.md`.

## Conventions

### Research Integrity
- **Types defined by electoral behavior**: Types are discovered directly from county-level shift vectors via KMeans clustering. No demographic inputs to discovery. See ADR-005 (shift-based) and ADR-006 (type-primary pivot).
- **Falsifiability via leave-one-pair-out CV**: Hold out each election pair in turn, predict held-out shifts via type structure. If types fail to predict, the model fails cleanly.
- **Demographics are descriptive + covariance construction**: After discovering types from shifts, overlay time-matched demographics (interpolated decennial census) to characterize types. Demographics also inform the type covariance matrix (Economist-inspired construction), but do NOT influence type discovery.
- **Assumptions are explicit**: Every modeling assumption is logged in `docs/ASSUMPTIONS_LOG.md` with its status (untested / supported / refuted).
- **Falsification over confirmation**: Design validation to try to break the model, not confirm it. Negative results are documented, not hidden.
- **Reproducibility**: All data transformations are scripted. No manual steps between raw data and outputs. Random seeds are pinned.

### Data
- **Free data only for MVP**: Census, ACS, election returns, FEC, religious congregation data -- all publicly available at no cost.
- **County-level primary**: The unit of analysis is the county (293 in FL+GA+AL). Tract-level refinement deferred to post-MVP when precinct data coverage improves.
- **Soft assignment**: Counties have mixed membership across types via KMeans inverse-distance scores. Scores are always in [0,1], row-normalized to sum to 1.
- **Census interpolation**: Decennial census (2000/2010/2020) linearly interpolated for election years. Provides time-matched demographics for type description and covariance construction.

### Code
- **Python formatting**: ruff for linting and formatting
- **R formatting**: styler package conventions
- **Stan models**: one .stan file per model, documented parameter blocks
- **Naming**: snake_case everywhere (Python, R, file names)
- **Data flow**: each pipeline stage reads from and writes to `data/` subdirectories; stages are independently re-runnable

### Dual Output
- The model produces two estimates per community-type-county combination: **vote share** (D/R split) and **turnout** (participation rate). These are modeled jointly because they covary.

## Known Tech Debt

(None yet -- project is pre-implementation.)

## Constraints

- **Free data only**: Census, ACS, election returns, congregation data, public polls. No paid subscriptions.
- **October 2026 target**: Functional public prediction tool for the 2026 midterms. Hard external deadline.
- **FL+GA+AL pilot first**: County model and visualization ship before national expansion. But architecture must support national from day one.
- **Build it right, not fast**: Operational complexity is no longer a constraint to minimize. Correct models and expandable architecture take priority.
- **Public-facing**: Code quality, documentation, and methodology must be publication-ready. Assume others will read and attempt to replicate.
- **Hybrid stack**: Python + R + Stan. Stan is the bridge — both cmdstanpy and cmdstanr compile the same .stan files. FastAPI exposes outputs; React + Deck.gl consumes them.
- **No proprietary models**: All inference is transparent and reproducible.

## Key Decisions Log

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2026-03-10 | Python + R + Stan hybrid stack | Python for data wrangling and ML ecosystem; R for MRP (dominant in political science); Stan as the shared Bayesian engine both can call |
| 2026-03-10 | Community-type soft assignment (mixed membership) | Counties are not monolithic -- a county can be 40% "rural evangelical" and 30% "college-town professional." Hard clustering loses this signal |
| 2026-03-10 | FL+GA+AL proof-of-concept geography (226 counties) | Three-state cluster with diverse political geography (urban/rural, Black Belt, retirement communities, college towns). Large enough to test, small enough to iterate |
| 2026-03-10 | Dual output: vote share + turnout | Turnout variation is a major source of prediction error in political models. Modeling it jointly with vote share through shared community structure captures an effect most models miss |
| 2026-03-10 | Two-stage separation (non-political detection, political validation) | Core falsifiability mechanism. If community types discovered from religion/class/neighborhood do not predict political covariance, the hypothesis fails cleanly |
| 2026-03-10 | Free public data only for MVP | Census, ACS, election returns, congregation data, public polls. No budget for proprietary data. Sufficient for proof of concept |
| 2026-03-18 | K=7 NMF community types (canonical) | Separates Asian from Knowledge Worker/WFH — critical for geographic analysis. R²=0.661 (Strong). ~60% generic baseline is a valid finding, not a flaw. |
| 2026-03-18 | Multi-election validation complete (2016+2018+2020) | R²=0.689/0.636/0.661 — hypothesis confirmed across three cycles. c6 (Hispanic) realignment (+4.9%→+1.2% swing) detected. c6 and c4 negatively correlated — key signal for Stan factor model. Historical election set: 2016 pres + 2018 gov (FL+GA only; AL uncontested) + 2020 pres. |
| 2026-03-18 | Tikhonov ridge regression for 2022/2024 community back-calculation | Bayesian approach (bayesian_poll_update with Stan Sigma) fails for county-level back-calc: data precision (~670K per county × 67 counties) dominates prior precision (~500) by 1340:1 — posterior exits [0,1]. Vote-normalized Tikhonov solves `min_{0≤θ≤1} ||W_w·θ - y_w||² + λ||θ - θ₀||²`. Adaptive λ search finds minimum regularization keeping estimates physical. Prior chain: Stan(2016-2020) → 2022 governor → 2024 president. AL excluded from 2022 (MEDSL data quality); falls back to 2020 prior. |
| 2026-03-18 | Stage 4 poll propagation implemented in Python (not R+Stan MRP) | Lightweight Gaussian Bayesian update in `src/propagation/propagate_polls.py`: mu_post = Sigma_post(Sigma_prior⁻¹ mu_prior + Σ_polls Hᵀσ⁻²y). Uses Stan covariance matrix but does not require running Stan for each forecast. Full MRP (R+Stan) deferred to post-MVP; Python approach sufficient for state-level polls. |
| 2026-03-18 | 2026 forward prediction pipeline complete (placeholder polls) | `src/assembly/ingest_polls.py` + `data/polls/polls_2026.csv` + `src/prediction/predict_2026.py`. FL Senate: polls 43.9% → model 39.5% (R+21); GA Senate: polls 50.5% → model 43.4% (R+13). Model applies structural downward correction to FL consistent with 2022/2024 validation showing ~5pp poll overestimate of Democrats. County predictions saved to `data/predictions/county_predictions_2026.parquet`. |
| 2026-03-18 | RCMS 2020 religious data integrated (county level) | `src/assembly/fetch_rcms.py` scrapes ARDA county map tool (parameterized GET, no login required). Produces `data/raw/rcms_county.parquet` (293 counties, 7 data cols). `build_features.py` computes 6 derived features → `data/assembled/county_rcms_features.parquet`. RCMS is county-level only; ACS tract features remain in separate file. 38 new tests in `tests/test_rcms.py`. |
| 2026-03-18 | IRS SOI county-to-county migration edge list integrated | `src/assembly/fetch_irs_migration.py` downloads IRS SOI inflow CSVs (default: latest 3 year pairs: 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022). Filters to flows involving FL/GA/AL, skips aggregate rows (statefips ≥ 96) and non-migrant same-county rows. Produces `data/raw/irs_migration.parquet` (edge list: origin_fips, dest_fips, n_returns, n_exemptions, agi, year_pair). Inflow-only design avoids double-counting. 48 new tests in `tests/test_irs_migration.py`. Feature computation from edge list deferred to post-MVP. |
| 2026-03-18 | Shift-based community discovery replaces NMF-on-demographics | Communities now discovered directly from spatially correlated electoral shift vectors (9-dim: D/R/turnout changes across three election pairs), using hierarchical agglomerative clustering with Queen spatial contiguity. The historical two-stage approach (NMF on ACS+RCMS → political validation) achieved R²~0.66 but imposed an indirect discovery path. Shift-based approach is more direct: communities are defined by how they move politically, not demographic proxies. Falsifiability moves from "do demographics predict covariance?" to "do communities from pre-2024 shifts predict 2024 shifts?" See ADR-005. |
| 2026-03-19 | County level is the primary model engine; tracts are a future refinement layer | Tract-level clustering produces r=-0.14 on holdout (data artifact: 6/9 shift dims are county-level MEDSL, so all tracts within a county receive identical values). County-level clustering produces r=0.93–0.98. County is the realistic common denominator for 2000–2024 data; tract-level refinement deferred to post-MVP when VEST-style harmonized precinct data for pre-2016 cycles becomes available. |
| 2026-03-19 | County model extended to 2000–2024 via MEDSL presidential + Algara/Amlani governor | 3-cycle baseline (2016–2024) extended to 12 cycles (2000–2024). Adds 4 presidential pairs (2000→2004, …, 2012→2016) and 5 governor pairs (2002→2006, …, 2018→2022). Training dims: 6 → 30. Sources: MEDSL doi:10.7910/DVN/VOQCHQ; Algara/Amlani doi:10.7910/DVN/DGUMFI. AL 2018 governor was contested (Ivey vs Maddox, ~60/40) — real data used, no structural zeros. |
| 2026-03-19 | Multi-year holdout r=0.87 (k=5, training col 16→20 vs holdout 20→24); 3-cycle baseline r=0.98 | Delta ~-0.11. Multi-year model is slightly weaker on short-run holdout: 30 dims average over 20 years of electoral history, pulling communities toward older patterns rather than recent momentum. This is expected and acceptable — temporal depth and structural robustness are the multi-year model's value, not short-run autocorrelation. Both approaches confirm strong community structure in FL/GA/AL electoral geography. |
| 2026-03-19 | Phase 1 K selection: K=10 (holdout r=0.9027) | K selection sweep over K=5..30 with spatial Ward HAC and min community size 8. K=10 maximizes holdout Pearson r between community-mean pres_d_shift_16_20 (training) and pres_d_shift_20_24 (holdout). 3-cycle baseline at K=10 was r=0.941; multi-year model gives r=0.9027. |
| 2026-03-19 | Phase 1 NMF types: J=7 | J sweep over 5-8; J=7 chosen for interpretability and consistency with project history. Type weights stored in county_type_assignments.parquet. |
| 2026-03-19 | Phase 1 Stan Σ: county HAC model, T=5 elections | Stan rank-1 factor model fit on 5 elections (2016 pres, 2018 gov, 2020 pres, 2022 gov, 2024 pres). k_ref selected dynamically as most Democratic community. Σ stored at data/covariance/county_community_sigma.parquet. DuckDB has community_sigma table. |
| 2026-03-19 | Phase 2 API architecture: FastAPI + DuckDB read-only + in-process Bayesian update | FastAPI opens bedrock.duckdb read-only at startup; loads K×K sigma, mu_prior, and weight matrices into app.state. All data endpoints are simple SQL queries via Depends(get_db). POST /forecast/poll calls bayesian_update() from src/prediction/predict_2026_hac.py (HAC K=10 pipeline) — NOT propagate_polls.py (old NMF K=7). Test isolation via create_app(lifespan_override=_noop_lifespan) factory + in-memory DuckDB fixture. |
| 2026-03-19 | Phase 2 frontend: Next.js App Router + Deck.gl + Observable Plot | Persistent choropleth map (left) + tabbed right panel. Tab bar holds View 3 (Forecast) now; Views 2 and 4 slot in as future tabs. Community age slider (3–10 training pairs) deferred to future phase. Visual style: Clean Academic (light background, Georgia serif headings, #2166ac/#d73027 partisan colors). |
| 2026-03-20 | Type-primary architecture pivot (ADR-006) | Types become the primary predictive engine, replacing HAC geographic communities. KMeans on 293 county shift vectors (33 training dims, 2008+, presidential×2.5 weighted) discovers J=20 types. Types carry covariance and prediction. Geographic communities deferred to tract phase. Motivated by: HAC K=10 produced "alternative states" (10 giant blobs), not the stained glass pattern of many small units colored by behavioral type. |
| 2026-03-20 | KMeans for type discovery (not SVD/NMF) | SVD+varimax produced degenerate 2-type solution (r=0.35). NMF requires non-negative input. KMeans achieves holdout r=0.778 with presidential×2.5 weighting. |
| 2026-03-20 | Economist-inspired covariance construction (not Stan estimation) | Construct J×J type covariance from demographic profiles (Pearson correlation + shrinkage toward all-1s + PD enforcement), following Heidemanns/Gelman/Morris 2020. Validated against observed comovement; hybrid fallback if off-diagonal r < 0.4. Stan factor model retained as ultimate fallback. Deterministic Python, no sampling needed. |
| 2026-03-20 | Census interpolation for time-matched demographics | Decennial census 2000/2010/2020 at county level, linearly interpolated for election years. Demographics describe types and construct covariance. ACS 2022 preferred where it provides better temporal resolution. CPI-adjusted income before interpolation. |
| 2026-03-20 | Hierarchical type nesting: J fine types → 5-8 super-types | Fine types give model resolution; super-types give public interpretability. Ward HAC on type loadings (no spatial constraint). Super-types are the "colors" of the stained glass map. |
| 2026-03-20 | 293 counties in FL+GA+AL (not 226) | All three states included. Prior references to 226 counties were FL+GA only (pre-AL inclusion). |
