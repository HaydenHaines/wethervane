# Project: US Political Covariation Model

A research model that discovers community types from non-political data (religion, class/occupation, neighborhood characteristics), estimates how those community types covary politically using historical election results, and propagates polling information through the learned covariance structure to produce community-level political estimates. The proof-of-concept geography is FL+GA+AL (226 counties), targeting functional predictions by the October 2026 midterms.

**Core insight:** communities that share social identity and behavioral patterns will covary politically, even when geographically separated. Detecting these communities from non-political data and then separately estimating their political covariance avoids circular reasoning and produces a falsifiable model.

## Architecture

Six-stage pipeline with strict separation between community detection (non-political) and political validation:

1. **Data Assembly** -- Ingest and harmonize census, ACS, religious congregation, occupation, and neighborhood data at the county level
2. **Community Detection** -- Discover latent community types from non-political features using soft assignment (mixed membership)
3. **Covariance Estimation** -- Estimate how community types covary politically using historical election data (Stan)
4. **Poll Propagation** -- Propagate current polling data through the community covariance structure using MRP (R + Stan)
5. **Prediction / Interpretation** -- Generate county-level dual estimates: vote share and turnout
6. **Validation** -- Holdout backtesting, cross-validation, calibration checks

**Separate silo: Political Sabermetrics** -- Advanced analytics for politician performance. Shares data infrastructure with the covariance pipeline but has its own compute pipeline. Decomposes election outcomes into district baseline + national environment + candidate effect. When the covariance model is available, candidate effects are further decomposed by community type (CTOV). See `docs/SABERMETRICS_ARCHITECTURE.md`.

See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for the full technical specification.

## Tech Stack

- **Python** -- Data assembly, community detection, feature engineering, prediction, visualization
- **R** -- MRP (multilevel regression and poststratification), poll propagation
- **Stan** -- Bayesian modeling bridge between Python and R ecosystems
- **Key Python packages**: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, cmdstanpy, pymc (evaluation), geopandas, matplotlib/plotly
- **Key R packages**: brms, rstanarm, tidyverse, survey, lme4
- **Data formats**: Parquet (intermediate data), CSV (raw inputs), NetCDF or Arrow (covariance matrices)
- **Environment**: pyproject.toml (Python), renv.lock (R)

## Conventions

### Research Integrity
- **Two-stage separation is sacred**: Community detection uses ONLY non-political data. Political data enters ONLY at the covariance estimation stage. This is the core falsifiability mechanism -- if non-political community structure does not predict political covariance, the hypothesis is wrong.
- **Assumptions are explicit**: Every modeling assumption is logged in `docs/ASSUMPTIONS_LOG.md` with its status (untested / supported / refuted).
- **Falsification over confirmation**: Design validation to try to break the model, not confirm it. Negative results are documented, not hidden.
- **Reproducibility**: All data transformations are scripted. No manual steps between raw data and outputs. Random seeds are pinned.

### Data
- **Free data only for MVP**: Census, ACS, election returns, FEC, religious congregation data -- all publicly available at no cost.
- **Census tract resolution**: The unit of analysis is the census tract (9,393 in FL+GA+AL per 2022 ACS). See ADR-004. County-level data may be used where tract-level is unavailable, but all community assignments and predictions are at tract level.
- **Soft assignment**: Counties have mixed membership across community types (probability vectors), not hard cluster labels.

### Code
- **Python formatting**: ruff for linting and formatting
- **R formatting**: styler package conventions
- **Stan models**: one .stan file per model, documented parameter blocks
- **Naming**: snake_case everywhere (Python, R, file names)
- **Data flow**: each pipeline stage reads from and writes to `data/` subdirectories; stages are independently re-runnable

### Dual Output
- The model produces two estimates per community-type-county combination: **vote share** (D/R split) and **turnout** (participation rate). These are modeled jointly because they covary.

## Known Tech Debt

(None yet -- project is pre-implementation.)

## Constraints

- **Free data only for MVP**: No paid data subscriptions. Census, ACS, election returns, congregation data, and public polls are all freely available.
- **Personal research project**: Solo developer, hobby pace. Architecture decisions should minimize operational complexity.
- **October 2026 target**: Functional prediction system for the 2026 midterm elections. This is a hard external deadline.
- **Proof-of-concept geography**: FL+GA+AL only (226 counties). National expansion is a post-MVP goal.
- **Hybrid stack complexity**: Python + R + Stan requires careful interface design. Stan is the bridge -- both cmdstanpy and rstan/cmdstanr can compile and run the same .stan files.
- **No proprietary models**: All modeling code is transparent. No black-box APIs for core inference.

## Key Decisions Log

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2026-03-10 | Python + R + Stan hybrid stack | Python for data wrangling and ML ecosystem; R for MRP (dominant in political science); Stan as the shared Bayesian engine both can call |
| 2026-03-10 | Community-type soft assignment (mixed membership) | Counties are not monolithic -- a county can be 40% "rural evangelical" and 30% "college-town professional." Hard clustering loses this signal |
| 2026-03-10 | FL+GA+AL proof-of-concept geography (226 counties) | Three-state cluster with diverse political geography (urban/rural, Black Belt, retirement communities, college towns). Large enough to test, small enough to iterate |
| 2026-03-10 | Dual output: vote share + turnout | Turnout variation is a major source of prediction error in political models. Modeling it jointly with vote share through shared community structure captures an effect most models miss |
| 2026-03-10 | Two-stage separation (non-political detection, political validation) | Core falsifiability mechanism. If community types discovered from religion/class/neighborhood do not predict political covariance, the hypothesis fails cleanly |
| 2026-03-10 | Free public data only for MVP | Census, ACS, election returns, congregation data, public polls. No budget for proprietary data. Sufficient for proof of concept |
| 2026-03-18 | K=7 NMF community types (canonical) | Separates Asian from Knowledge Worker/WFH — critical for geographic analysis. R²=0.661 (Strong). ~60% generic baseline is a valid finding, not a flaw. |
| 2026-03-18 | Multi-election validation complete (2016+2018+2020) | R²=0.689/0.636/0.661 — hypothesis confirmed across three cycles. c6 (Hispanic) realignment (+4.9%→+1.2% swing) detected. c6 and c4 negatively correlated — key signal for Stan factor model. Historical election set: 2016 pres + 2018 gov (FL+GA only; AL uncontested) + 2020 pres. |
| 2026-03-18 | Tikhonov ridge regression for 2022/2024 community back-calculation | Bayesian approach (bayesian_poll_update with Stan Sigma) fails for county-level back-calc: data precision (~670K per county × 67 counties) dominates prior precision (~500) by 1340:1 — posterior exits [0,1]. Vote-normalized Tikhonov solves `min_{0≤θ≤1} ||W_w·θ - y_w||² + λ||θ - θ₀||²`. Adaptive λ search finds minimum regularization keeping estimates physical. Prior chain: Stan(2016-2020) → 2022 governor → 2024 president. AL excluded from 2022 (MEDSL data quality); falls back to 2020 prior. |
| 2026-03-18 | Stage 4 poll propagation implemented in Python (not R+Stan MRP) | Lightweight Gaussian Bayesian update in `src/propagation/propagate_polls.py`: mu_post = Sigma_post(Sigma_prior⁻¹ mu_prior + Σ_polls Hᵀσ⁻²y). Uses Stan covariance matrix but does not require running Stan for each forecast. Full MRP (R+Stan) deferred to post-MVP; Python approach sufficient for state-level polls. |
| 2026-03-18 | 2026 forward prediction pipeline complete (placeholder polls) | `src/assembly/ingest_polls.py` + `data/polls/polls_2026.csv` + `src/prediction/predict_2026.py`. FL Senate: polls 43.9% → model 39.5% (R+21); GA Senate: polls 50.5% → model 43.4% (R+13). Model applies structural downward correction to FL consistent with 2022/2024 validation showing ~5pp poll overestimate of Democrats. County predictions saved to `data/predictions/county_predictions_2026.parquet`. |
