# Project: US Political Covariation Model

A research model that discovers community types from non-political data (religion, class/occupation, neighborhood characteristics), estimates how those community types covary politically using historical election results, and propagates polling information through the learned covariance structure to produce community-level political estimates. The proof-of-concept geography is FL+GA+AL (226 counties), targeting functional predictions by the October 2026 midterms.

**Core insight:** communities that share social identity and behavioral patterns will covary politically, even when geographically separated. Detecting these communities from non-political data and then separately estimating their political covariance avoids circular reasoning and produces a falsifiable model.

## Architecture

Six-stage pipeline with strict separation between community detection (non-political) and political validation:

1. **Data Assembly** -- Ingest and harmonize census, ACS, religious congregation, occupation, and neighborhood data at the county level
2. **Community Detection** -- Discover latent community types from non-political features using soft assignment (mixed membership)
3. **Covariance Estimation** -- Estimate how community types covary politically using historical election data (Stan)
4. **Poll Propagation** -- Propagate current polling data through the community covariance structure using MRP (R + Stan)
5. **Prediction / Interpretation** -- Generate county-level dual estimates: vote share and turnout
6. **Validation** -- Holdout backtesting, cross-validation, calibration checks

See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for the full technical specification.

## Tech Stack

- **Python** -- Data assembly, community detection, feature engineering, prediction, visualization
- **R** -- MRP (multilevel regression and poststratification), poll propagation
- **Stan** -- Bayesian modeling bridge between Python and R ecosystems
- **Key Python packages**: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, cmdstanpy, pymc (evaluation), geopandas, matplotlib/plotly
- **Key R packages**: brms, rstanarm, tidyverse, survey, lme4
- **Data formats**: Parquet (intermediate data), CSV (raw inputs), NetCDF or Arrow (covariance matrices)
- **Environment**: pyproject.toml (Python), renv.lock (R)

## Conventions

### Research Integrity
- **Two-stage separation is sacred**: Community detection uses ONLY non-political data. Political data enters ONLY at the covariance estimation stage. This is the core falsifiability mechanism -- if non-political community structure does not predict political covariance, the hypothesis is wrong.
- **Assumptions are explicit**: Every modeling assumption is logged in `docs/ASSUMPTIONS_LOG.md` with its status (untested / supported / refuted).
- **Falsification over confirmation**: Design validation to try to break the model, not confirm it. Negative results are documented, not hidden.
- **Reproducibility**: All data transformations are scripted. No manual steps between raw data and outputs. Random seeds are pinned.

### Data
- **Free data only for MVP**: Census, ACS, election returns, FEC, religious congregation data -- all publicly available at no cost.
- **County-level resolution**: The unit of analysis is the county (FIPS code). Sub-county data may be used as features but predictions are at county level.
- **Soft assignment**: Counties have mixed membership across community types (probability vectors), not hard cluster labels.

### Code
- **Python formatting**: ruff for linting and formatting
- **R formatting**: styler package conventions
- **Stan models**: one .stan file per model, documented parameter blocks
- **Naming**: snake_case everywhere (Python, R, file names)
- **Data flow**: each pipeline stage reads from and writes to `data/` subdirectories; stages are independently re-runnable

### Dual Output
- The model produces two estimates per community-type-county combination: **vote share** (D/R split) and **turnout** (participation rate). These are modeled jointly because they covary.

## Known Tech Debt

(None yet -- project is pre-implementation.)

## Constraints

- **Free data only for MVP**: No paid data subscriptions. Census, ACS, election returns, congregation data, and public polls are all freely available.
- **Personal research project**: Solo developer, hobby pace. Architecture decisions should minimize operational complexity.
- **October 2026 target**: Functional prediction system for the 2026 midterm elections. This is a hard external deadline.
- **Proof-of-concept geography**: FL+GA+AL only (226 counties). National expansion is a post-MVP goal.
- **Hybrid stack complexity**: Python + R + Stan requires careful interface design. Stan is the bridge -- both cmdstanpy and rstan/cmdstanr can compile and run the same .stan files.
- **No proprietary models**: All modeling code is transparent. No black-box APIs for core inference.

## Key Decisions Log

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2026-03-10 | Python + R + Stan hybrid stack | Python for data wrangling and ML ecosystem; R for MRP (dominant in political science); Stan as the shared Bayesian engine both can call |
| 2026-03-10 | Community-type soft assignment (mixed membership) | Counties are not monolithic -- a county can be 40% "rural evangelical" and 30% "college-town professional." Hard clustering loses this signal |
| 2026-03-10 | FL+GA+AL proof-of-concept geography (226 counties) | Three-state cluster with diverse political geography (urban/rural, Black Belt, retirement communities, college towns). Large enough to test, small enough to iterate |
| 2026-03-10 | Dual output: vote share + turnout | Turnout variation is a major source of prediction error in political models. Modeling it jointly with vote share through shared community structure captures an effect most models miss |
| 2026-03-10 | Two-stage separation (non-political detection, political validation) | Core falsifiability mechanism. If community types discovered from religion/class/neighborhood do not predict political covariance, the hypothesis fails cleanly |
| 2026-03-10 | Free public data only for MVP | Census, ACS, election returns, congregation data, public polls. No budget for proprietary data. Sufficient for proof of concept |
