        How WetherVane discovers electoral structure and produces forecasts.

      <Section title="What is WetherVane?">
        <p>
          WetherVane is a structural model of electoral behavior. Rather than treating
          polls as the whole story, it discovers hidden patterns in how communities
          shift politically across elections — and uses that structure to propagate
          new information across geography.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most forecasting models are poll aggregators: they average polls, adjust
          for house effects, and output a number. WetherVane starts from a different
          question: <em>what is the underlying structure that makes places move
          together?</em> Understanding that structure — not just the surface
          results — is what makes prediction defensible.
        </p>
        <p>
          The target audience is anyone who wants to understand electoral dynamics,
          not just consume a top-line forecast. If you read FiveThirtyEight for the
          methodology write-ups, this is for you.

      {/* Section 2: How It Works */}
      <Section title="How It Works">
        <Step number={1} title="Discover Types">
          <p>
            The model begins by computing how every county shifted politically
            across each pair of elections from 2008 to 2024. These shift vectors
            capture the direction and magnitude of change — did this county swing
            toward Democrats or Republicans, and by how much?
          </p>
          <p>
            KMeans clustering (J=100) groups counties with similar shift patterns
            into <strong>electoral types</strong>. Presidential shifts are
            weighted <strong>8x</strong> because they carry cross-state signal.
            Governor and Senate shifts are state-centered first (subtracting the
            statewide swing) so that clustering captures within-state variation,
            not just red-state/blue-state differences.
          </p>
        </Step>

        <Step number={2} title="Soft Membership">
          <p>
            No county belongs to just one type. Each county has partial membership
            in multiple types, computed via temperature-scaled inverse distance in
            shift space. A suburban Atlanta county might be 40% "College-Educated
            Suburban" and 30% "Black Belt &amp; Diverse."
          </p>
          <p>
            This soft membership (temperature T=10) reduces calibration error
            by ~37% compared to hard assignment, because real places are
            mixtures.
          </p>
        </Step>

        <Step number={3} title="Covariance Structure">
          <p>
            Types that share electoral behavior tend to move together
            politically. The model estimates a covariance matrix capturing how
            much each pair of types co-moves, using observed electoral
            correlation with Ledoit-Wolf regularization.
          </p>
          <p>
            This observed covariance (validation r = 0.915) captures the real
            co-movement structure between types, validated against held-out
            election cycles.
          </p>
        </Step>

        <Step number={4} title="Poll Propagation">
          <p>
            When a new poll comes in, the model does not just update the polled
            state. It propagates information to every county through the type
            covariance structure. A Florida poll shifts Georgia predictions
            too, because both states contain counties that share type
            memberships.
          </p>
          <p>
            The update mechanism is a Bayesian Gaussian (Kalman filter)
            update — exact and closed-form, no simulation needed.
          </p>
        </Step>

        <Step number={5} title="County Predictions">
          <p>
            Each county's prediction starts from its own historical baseline
            (its actual results in prior elections), then adjusts based on how
            much its types shifted according to polls. The adjustment respects
            each county's unique type composition — two counties in the same
            state can move in opposite directions if their type profiles differ.

            <strong>Structure from behavior, not demographics.</strong>{" "}
            Types are discovered from how places shift electorally. Demographics
            describe the types after discovery — they do not define them. This
            avoids baking in assumptions about which voters matter.
          </>,
          <>
            <strong>Cross-state information sharing.</strong>{" "}
            Because types cross state lines, a poll in one state informs
            predictions in another. Most models treat states as independent.

            <strong>Transparent and interpretable.</strong>{" "}
            Every prediction traces back to specific types, their shift
