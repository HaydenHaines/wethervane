          WetherVane discovers communities of voters who move together
          politically — then uses that structure to propagate new information
          across geography. A poll in one state updates predictions in every
          state that shares those communities.

      {/* The Key Insight */}
      <Section title="The Key Insight" id="key-insight">
        <p>
          Most forecasting models treat counties as independent: average the
          polls, adjust for house effects, output a number. WetherVane starts
          from a different question: <em>what is the underlying structure that
          makes places move together?</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Thousands of places share hidden behavioral patterns. A rural
          evangelical county in Georgia moves with rural evangelical counties in
          Iowa — not because anyone coordinates, but because the same forces act
          on similar communities. Discovering that structure — not just reading
          the surface results — is what makes prediction defensible.
        </p>
        <p>
          The model is built for readers who want to understand electoral
          dynamics, not just consume a top-line forecast. If you read
          FiveThirtyEight for the methodology write-ups, this is for you.
        </p>
      </Section>

      <Divider />

      {/* How It Works */}
      <Section title="How It Works" id="how-it-works">
        <Step number={1} title="Discover Types">
          <p>
            The model begins by computing how every county shifted politically
            across each pair of elections from 2008 to 2024. These shift vectors
            capture direction and magnitude — did this county swing toward
            Democrats or Republicans, and by how much?
          </p>
          <p>
            KMeans clustering (<strong>J=100</strong>) groups counties with
            similar shift patterns into <strong>electoral types</strong>.
            Presidential shifts are weighted <strong>8×</strong> because they
            carry cross-state signal (the same national forces act on similar
            communities everywhere). Governor and Senate shifts are{" "}
            <em>state-centered</em> first — subtracting the statewide swing —
            so that clustering captures within-state variation, not just
            red-state/blue-state geography.
          </p>
          <p>
            The result is 100 fine-grained electoral types and 5{" "}
            <strong>super-types</strong> (broad behavioral families), which
            form the colors of the stained glass map.
          </p>
        </Step>

        <Step number={2} title="Soft Membership">
          <p>
            No county belongs to just one type. Each county has partial
            membership in multiple types, computed via temperature-scaled
            inverse distance in shift space. A suburban Atlanta county might be
            40% "College-Educated Suburban" and 30% "Black Belt &amp; Diverse."
          </p>
          <p>
            This soft membership (temperature <strong>T=10</strong>) reduces
            calibration error by ~37% compared to hard assignment, because real
            places are mixtures. The map color reflects dominant type, but
            predictions use the full membership vector.
          </p>
        </Step>

        <Step number={3} title="Covariance Structure">
          <p>
            Types that share electoral behavior tend to move together
            politically. The model estimates a 100×100 covariance matrix
            capturing how much each pair of types co-moves, using observed
            electoral correlation with Ledoit-Wolf regularization.
          </p>
          <p>
            This observed covariance (validation r = <strong>0.915</strong>)
            is the key structural object. It encodes which types are
            behaviorally coupled — and therefore how information should flow
            between them when a new poll arrives.
          </p>
        </Step>

        <Step number={4} title="Poll Propagation">
          <p>
            When a new poll comes in, the model does not just update the polled
            state. It propagates information to every county through the type
            covariance structure. A Florida Senate poll shifts Georgia
            predictions too, because both states contain counties that share
            type memberships.
          </p>
          <p>
            The update mechanism is a{" "}
            <strong>Bayesian Gaussian (Kalman filter) update</strong> — exact
            and closed-form, no simulation needed. Multiple polls stack as
            independent observations rather than collapsing to an average,
            preserving the information in each.
          </p>
        </Step>

        <Step number={5} title="County Predictions">
          <p>
            Each county&apos;s prediction starts from its historical baseline
            (actual results in prior elections), then adjusts based on how much
            its types shifted according to polls. The adjustment respects each
            county&apos;s unique type composition — two counties in the same
            state can move in opposite directions if their type profiles differ.
          </p>
          <p>
            The final ensemble uses a{" "}
            <strong>Ridge + Histogram Gradient Boosting</strong> combination
            with 160 features from 8 independent data sources, achieving a
            leave-one-out r of <strong>0.711</strong> — the honest
            out-of-sample accuracy measure.

          The model&apos;s honest test is leave-one-out cross-validation:
          predict each county while excluding it from its type average. The
          ensemble achieves <strong>LOO r=0.711</strong> across 3,106 matched
          counties, using 160 features from 8 independent data sources.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cross-election validation tests whether the type structure discovered
          from historical shifts generalizes to new cycles. Across four
          presidential elections (2012–2016, 2016–2020, 2020–2024, and one
          earlier cycle), mean LOO r = <strong>0.476 ± 0.10</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not all cycles are equally predictable.{" "}
          <strong>2024 (r=0.40)</strong> was the hardest — the Harris-Trump
          dynamic produced unusual cross-type movement, particularly among
          Hispanic communities. The{" "}
          <strong>2012→2016 transition (r=0.64)</strong> was most predictable:
          Trump&apos;s initial surge followed existing type fault lines closely.
        </p>
        <p style={{ color: "var(--color-text-muted)", fontSize: "14px" }}>
          Note: The standard holdout r (0.698) is inflated by ~0.22 because
          counties predict their own type means. LOO is the correct metric for
          evaluating generalization. Both are reported for transparency.

          <strong>Planned improvements:</strong> BEA regional economic data,
          FEC donor density features, richer poll ingestion with crosstab
          disaggregation (crosstabs tell us which types were sampled — a poll
          oversampling college-educated voters should pull harder on types with
          high college-educated membership).
