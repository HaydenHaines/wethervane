# Autonomous Improvement TODOs — Bedrock Model

These tasks can be picked up independently by autonomous sessions. **Work them in priority order.** Each task should be a single session's work, with tests and a commit on `feat/type-primary-architecture`.

**Baseline model (2026-03-22 S164 updated):**
- Algorithm: KMeans J=43
- Features: Presidential×2.5 + state-centered gov/Senate (33 dims, 2008+)
- Holdout r: 0.828 (county-level prior), 0.818 (type-mean prior)
- Calibration MAE: 0.061 (T=10 soft membership)
- Covariance validation r: 0.210 (3-dimensional observed structure)
- County RMSE (2024): **2.67pp** (county-prior), 9.00pp (type-mean prior)
- Feature count: 42 numeric (including migration features)

**Validation command:** `uv run python -m src.validation.validate_types`
**Test command:** `uv run pytest tests/ -q --tb=short`
**Pipeline rebuild:** After any model change, re-run type discovery → nesting → description → covariance → DuckDB rebuild → restart services.

## Priority 1 — Fix the Prediction Pipeline (biggest error source)

These are the highest-impact improvements. The prediction pipeline has known structural problems.

- [x] **P1.1: County-level priors instead of type means** — DONE S164. County RMSE: 9.00pp → 2.67pp (70% improvement). Black Belt RMSE: 12.73pp → 3.13pp. See docs/spot-check-county-priors-S164.md.

- [x] **P1.2: Covariance rank reduction via PCA** — DONE S164. Code added (`_rank_reduce`, `max_rank` param) but inactive. Experiment showed validation r is flat across ALL parameter combos. Root cause: demographic similarity ≠ electoral comovement. Observed structure is 3-dimensional. See docs/covariance-experiment-S164.md.

- [x] **P1.3: Negative correlation preservation** — DONE S164. floor_negatives=False makes no difference (0.205 vs 0.202). Dead end — confirmed in same experiment.

---

## Priority 2 — Expand Feature Space (fixes rank deficiency)

41 features for 43 types = near-singular covariance. Need ≥43 features for full rank. These tasks add features from data already on disk or freely available.

- [x] **P2.1: Extend governor shift data pre-2000** — DONE S164. Added 1994 and 1998 governor pairs from Algara data. Training dims: 54 → 60 (+6). Pre-2008, so not used in KMeans but available for county priors.

- [x] **P2.2: Urbanicity feature (Economist-style)** — DONE (pre-S164). `log_pop_density`, `land_area_sq_mi`, `pop_per_sq_mi` already integrated into type_profiles.parquet. The Economist-style `avg_log_pop_within_5_miles` is unnecessary — raw log density already distinguishes urban/suburban/rural effectively.

- [ ] **P2.3: FEC donor density feature** — Requires FEC_API_KEY (free from api.data.gov/signup/). Fetcher exists at `src/assembly/fetch_fec_contributions.py` (29 tests in worktree). Microdonation rate per county as a type discriminator. **BLOCKED on API key — ask Hayden via Telegram if not set.**

- [ ] **P2.4: BEA income composition** — Requires BEA_API_KEY (free from apps.bea.gov/API/signup/). Fetcher exists at `src/assembly/fetch_bea_income.py` (38 tests). Income from wages vs transfers vs investments. **BLOCKED on API key — ask Hayden via Telegram if not set.**

- [x] **P2.5: IRS migration features** — DONE (pre-S164). 4 features integrated into type profiles. 39 tests.

After completing P2 tasks, re-run shrinkage lambda tuning — the rank deficiency was the reason lambda had no effect (S162). With ≥43 features it may matter.

## Priority 3 — Clustering Algorithm Experiments

KMeans at J=43 with r=0.818 is solid. These experiments may find marginal gains but are lower priority than fixing prediction and covariance. **Run one per session. If it doesn't beat baseline, document why and move on.**

- [x] **P3.1: Gaussian Mixture Models** — DONE S164. GMM diagonal beats KMeans at J=43 (0.847 vs 0.832 holdout_r, +1.5%) but KMeans wins at J=50. Marginal gains. Recommendation: keep KMeans. See docs/gmm-experiment-S164.md.

- [ ] **P3.2: MiniBatch KMeans stability** — Test centroid stability via bootstrap (100 random starts). Measure how often counties switch types across runs. If unstable, consider ensemble averaging. Lower priority — current model seems stable in practice.

- [ ] **P3.3: Spectral clustering** — Test with k-nearest-neighbors affinity, J=43. Can find non-convex clusters KMeans misses. Research: spectral clustering in electoral geography.

- [ ] **P3.4: HDBSCAN with auto-J** — Discovers J from data density. Interesting but risky — may produce very different J than 43. Counties in sparse regions become "noise."

- [ ] **P3.5: Turnout as separate dimension** — Turnout-shift is redundant with 2-party D/R shifts. Test: cluster on turnout separately, merge with partisan types. Research: does turnout structure add predictive value for midterms?

---

## Priority 4 — Validation & Analysis

- [x] **P4.1: Variation partitioning** — DONE S175. Types R²=0.685, Demo R²=0.548, Combined R²=0.777. Unique to types: 22.9%, Unique to demo: 9.1%, Shared: 45.6%, Residual: 22.3%. Types add substantial unique value. See docs/variation-partitioning-S175.md.

- [ ] **P4.2: Type stability on sub-windows** — Compare types from 2008-2016 vs 2016-2024. Current full-window stability fails (89.8° angular distance). Sub-windows should be more stable. Documents whether types are durable or period-specific.

---

## Priority 5 — Frontend & Visualization

These make the product more useful but don't improve model accuracy.

- [ ] **P5.1: Type-aware tooltips** — County hover shows: name, type name, Dem share, key demographics. Highest-value UX improvement.

- [ ] **P5.2: Type naming in legend** — Replace "Super-Type N" with descriptive names from DuckDB super_types table. Small effort.

- [ ] **P5.3: Type comparison table** — Side-by-side demographic profiles of selected types. Sortable columns.

- [ ] **P5.4: Shift Explorer view** — Scatter plot of counties colored by type, x/y axes selectable (e.g., pct_white vs pres_d_shift). For exploration and storytelling.

---

## Priority 6 — Data Source Research (research only, no implementation)

These are research tasks — web search and evaluation, not code. Output should be a findings doc in `docs/` with a recommendation on whether to proceed.

- [ ] **P6.1: County-level presidential returns pre-2000** — Need to extend to 1948+ for parity with Economist. Sources: ICPSR, Dave Leip, OpenElections, Wikipedia. Don't pay for data.

- [ ] **P6.2: CES/CCES survey data** — Individual-level validated vote + county geography. ~60K respondents/wave. Harvard Dataverse. For type validation (do self-reported party ID match type assignments?).

- [ ] **P6.3: VEST 2012/2014 precinct data quality** — Check VEST GitHub for FL/GA/AL coverage. Needed for future tract-level model.

- [ ] **P6.4: FL/GA voter file availability** — Public voter files could validate type assignments against registered party affiliation. Research format, access, academic precedent.

- [ ] **P6.5: Facebook Social Connectedness Index** — For propagation validation (do types that are socially connected also covary politically?). Not for discovery.

---

## Priority 7 — Infrastructure

- [ ] **P7.1: Real 2026 poll data** — Replace placeholder `polls_2026.csv`. Scrape from 538/RCP/Economist. Critical before October 2026 launch.

- [x] **P7.2: Model versioning** — DONE S175. Tagged `type-primary-v1.0` on main. KMeans J=43, holdout r=0.828, county RMSE 2.67pp, 1511 tests.

- [ ] **P7.3: CI/CD validation** — GitHub Action runs `validate_types` on push to feat/type-primary-architecture. Fail if holdout r drops below 0.80.
