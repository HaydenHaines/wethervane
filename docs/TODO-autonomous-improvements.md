# Autonomous Improvement TODOs — Bedrock Model

These tasks can be picked up independently by autonomous sessions. **Work them in priority order.** Each task should be a single session's work, with tests and a commit on `feat/type-primary-architecture`.

**Current model (2026-04-06 S340 updated):**
- Algorithm: KMeans J=100, PCA(n=15, whiten=True) before KMeans
- Features: Presidential pw=8.0 + state-centered gov/Senate (33 dims, 2008+)
- Holdout r: 0.698 (type-mean prior)
- LOO r (Ridge+features): **0.734** (43 pruned features, best achieved)
- Covariance validation r: **0.936** (observed LW-regularized)
- Coherence: 0.783, RMSE: 0.073
- Ensemble features: 43 pruned from 218 (type scores + demographics + religion + BEA + migration + health + urbanicity + broadband + Facebook SCI + QCEW industry)
- Tests: 3,474 pass
- **Feature engineering ceiling reached** — FEC (+0.0001), approval (~0), broadband (neutral) all failed to improve. Further gains require tract-primary migration or fundamentally new signal.

**Validation command:** `uv run python -m src.validation.validate_types`
**Test command:** `uv run pytest tests/ -q --tb=short`
**Pipeline rebuild:** After any model change, re-run type discovery → nesting → description → covariance → DuckDB rebuild → restart services.

## Priority 1 — Fix the Prediction Pipeline (biggest error source)

These are the highest-impact improvements. The prediction pipeline has known structural problems.

- [x] **P1.1: County-level priors instead of type means** — DONE S164. County RMSE: 9.00pp → 2.67pp (70% improvement). Black Belt RMSE: 12.73pp → 3.13pp. See docs/spot-check-county-priors-S164.md.

- [x] **P1.2: Covariance rank reduction via PCA** — DONE S164. Code added (`_rank_reduce`, `max_rank` param) but inactive. Experiment showed validation r is flat across ALL parameter combos. Root cause: demographic similarity ≠ electoral comovement. Observed structure is 3-dimensional. See docs/covariance-experiment-S164.md.

- [x] **P1.3: Negative correlation preservation** — DONE S164. floor_negatives=False makes no difference (0.205 vs 0.202). Dead end — confirmed in same experiment.

---

## Priority 2 — Expand Feature Space (fixes rank deficiency)

41 features for 43 types = near-singular covariance. Need ≥43 features for full rank. These tasks add features from data already on disk or freely available.

- [x] **P2.1: Extend governor shift data pre-2000** — DONE S164. Added 1994 and 1998 governor pairs from Algara data. Training dims: 54 → 60 (+6). Pre-2008, so not used in KMeans but available for county priors.

- [x] **P2.2: Urbanicity feature (Economist-style)** — DONE (pre-S164). `log_pop_density`, `land_area_sq_mi`, `pop_per_sq_mi` already integrated into type_profiles.parquet. The Economist-style `avg_log_pop_within_5_miles` is unnecessary — raw log density already distinguishes urban/suburban/rural effectively.

- [x] **P2.6: Denomination-level religion features (break out "Other")** — Current RCMS fetch uses "Major Religious Groups" (rt=2) which lumps LDS, Muslim, Jewish, Hindu, Buddhist, Jehovah's Witness, etc. into "Other." ARDA has denomination-level data (RCMS 2020, 366 denominations). Fetch county-level adherent counts for each politically distinct group within "Other" and create per-capita features. Priority groups and why they matter electorally:
  - **LDS/Mormon**: UT/ID/NV/AZ/WY corridor. Anti-Trump 2016 (McMullin), snap-back 2020+. Distinctive shift pattern likely blurred into "rural conservative."
  - **Muslim**: Concentrated in Dearborn MI, parts of NJ/NY/VA/TX/MN. Shifted sharply R in 2024 (Gaza). Small-n but high-signal where concentrated.
  - **Jewish**: NY metro, S. FL, parts of PA/MD. Consistently high-D but with notable 2024 movement. Captures Boca/Broward type signal.
  - **Hindu/Sikh**: Northern NJ, parts of TX/CA. Proxy for South Asian professional suburbs.
  - **Buddhist**: Minimal electoral signal, skip unless data shows otherwise.
  - **Jehovah's Witness**: Low voter participation, unlikely to help.
  Implementation: Fetch ARDA denomination-level CSV export for RCMS 2020. Compute `{group}_share = adherents / total_pop` per county. Add as ensemble features. Test each for holdout r improvement — drop any that don't help. Hayden's data scientist friend flagged Mormonism specifically (2026-03-27); expanded to all electorally distinct "Other" denominations.

- [x] **P2.3: FEC donor density feature** — DONE S340. National fetch (3,125 counties), county-level donor ratios. LOO r: +0.0001 (neutral). Donor behavior redundant with type scores. Branch preserved but not merged. REJECTED.

- [x] **P2.4: BEA income composition** — DONE S338. 3 features (earnings_share, transfers_share, investment_share). LOO r: 0.731→0.733 (+0.002), Covariance val r: 0.915→0.936 (+0.021). Merged to main.

- [x] **P2.5: IRS migration features** — DONE (pre-S164). 4 features integrated into type profiles. 39 tests.

**All P2 tasks complete.** Feature engineering at county-level has plateaued. BEA income (+0.002) and denomination religion (+0.001) were the only additions that helped. FEC state-level (-0.006) and FEC county-level (+0.0001) both rejected. Lambda/mu tuning was done in S293 (#91).

## Priority 3 — Clustering Algorithm Experiments

KMeans at J=43 with r=0.818 is solid. These experiments may find marginal gains but are lower priority than fixing prediction and covariance. **Run one per session. If it doesn't beat baseline, document why and move on.**

- [x] **P3.1: Gaussian Mixture Models** — DONE S164. GMM diagonal beats KMeans at J=43 (0.847 vs 0.832 holdout_r, +1.5%) but KMeans wins at J=50. Marginal gains. Recommendation: keep KMeans. See docs/gmm-experiment-S164.md.

- [x] **P3.2: KMeans stability** — DONE S165. Holdout r = 0.919 ± 0.004 across 50 random seeds. Stable for production. See docs/kmeans-stability-experiment-S165.md.

- [x] **P3.3: Spectral clustering** — DONE S175. Noise-level difference: spectral wins at J=43 (+0.006) but loses at J=50 (-0.009). No systematic advantage. KMeans confirmed. See docs/spectral-experiment-S175.md.

- [x] **P3.4: HDBSCAN with auto-J** — DONE S178. Fails decisively (r=0.53 vs KMeans 0.84). Finds state-level density, not electoral types. All clustering experiments complete except P3.5.

- [x] **P3.5: Turnout as separate dimension** — DONE S186. Current x1.0 weight is optimal. Dropping turnout costs -0.021r; up-weighting trades partisan accuracy for turnout with no net gain. Turnout-only r=0.79. ALL P3.x experiments COMPLETE. See docs/turnout-dimension-experiment-S186.md.

- [x] **P3.6: PCA/dimensionality reduction before KMeans** — Recommended by external data scientist (2026-03-27). Currently KMeans runs on raw 33-dim shift vectors. PCA could reduce noise dimensions (presidential shifts across years are highly correlated) and concentrate signal. Experiment: run PCA on shift matrix, sweep n_components (5-25), re-run KMeans J=100 on reduced space, compare holdout r to baseline 0.698. The Economist model uses a factor model on shifts (similar concept). Also try UMAP as a nonlinear alternative.

## Priority 4 — Validation & Analysis

- [x] **P4.1: Variation partitioning** — DONE S175. Types R²=0.685, Demo R²=0.548, Combined R²=0.777. Unique to types: 22.9%, Unique to demo: 9.1%, Shared: 45.6%, Residual: 22.3%. Types add substantial unique value. See docs/variation-partitioning-S175.md.

- [x] **P4.2: Type stability on sub-windows** — DONE S175. Cross-window ARI=0.113, NMI=0.582, county stability=32.4%. Seed ARI=0.440. Types partially stable — core structure preserved but assignments drift across eras. Full window outperforms sub-windows (r=0.854 vs 0.804/0.838). See docs/type-stability-subwindows-S175.md.

## Priority 5 — Frontend & Visualization

These make the product more useful but don't improve model accuracy.

- [x] **P5.1: Type-aware tooltips** — DONE S188. County hover shows type name, super-type, political lean, income, education, white NH %, density. Dark tooltip styling.

- [x] **P5.2: Type naming in legend** — DONE S188. 55 national type names from demographic z-scores. Data-driven super-type names. No "Type N" fallbacks.

- [x] **P5.3: Type comparison table** — DONE S189. "Compare" tab with side-by-side demographics for 2-4 types. Sortable columns. Subtle heatmap highlighting.

- [x] **P5.4: Shift Explorer view** — DONE S189. "Explore" tab with Observable Plot scatter. 55 types as dots, colored by super-type, sized by county count. Selectable X/Y axes.

## Priority 6 — Data Source Research (research only, no implementation)

These are research tasks — web search and evaluation, not code. Output should be a findings doc in `docs/` with a recommendation on whether to proceed.

- [ ] **P6.1: County-level presidential returns pre-2000** — Need to extend to 1948+ for parity with Economist. Sources: ICPSR, Dave Leip, OpenElections, Wikipedia. Don't pay for data.

- [x] **P6.2: CES/CCES survey data** — DONE S498-S499. Research complete, implementation dispatched. Cumulative 2006-2024 feather (141MB, 701K respondents). County FIPS join to types. Validation pipeline at `src/validation/validate_ces.py`.

- [ ] **P6.3: VEST 2012/2014 precinct data quality** — Check VEST GitHub for FL/GA/AL coverage. Needed for future tract-level model.

- [ ] **P6.4: FL/GA voter file availability** — Public voter files could validate type assignments against registered party affiliation. Research format, access, academic precedent.

- [ ] **P6.5: Facebook Social Connectedness Index** — For propagation validation (do types that are socially connected also covary politically?). Not for discovery.

---

## Priority 7 — Infrastructure

- [x] **P7.1: Real 2026 poll data** — DONE S176+S213. Cron-based poll scraper for 18 national races (6 original + 12 competitive Senate/Governor). 108 polls scraped. Silver Bulletin pollster ratings (539 pollsters). House effects correction (S230).

- [x] **P7.2: Model versioning** — DONE S175. Tagged `type-primary-v1.0` on main. KMeans J=43, holdout r=0.828, county RMSE 2.67pp, 1511 tests.

- [x] **P7.3: CI/CD validation** — DONE S175. GitHub Actions: lint + test + test count threshold.

## Priority 4 — Rich Poll Ingestion (Future Work)

These items build on the Tier 3 poll enrichment shipped in S249. See spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-03-29-rich-poll-ingestion-design.md`.

- [ ] **TODO-POLL-1: Crosstab Scraping Pipeline** — Per-pollster integrations for extracting demographic breakdowns from original poll releases (PDFs, pollster websites). Priority targets: Emerson College, Cygnal, Trafalgar, Quantus, TIPP Insights. No known structured API or aggregator exists. Enables Tier 2 W vectors — the biggest information gain. Each pollster is a separate parser.

- [ ] **TODO-POLL-2: Undersampled Group Identification** — Compare poll's inferred/actual demographic coverage against the *political diversity within demographic groups* in the polled state. Core insight: demographic representation ≠ type representation. A poll weighted to 33% Black in GA can still miss that Atlanta Black voters (Type 29) behave differently from rural SW GA Black voters (Type 50). Output: per-type σ inflation for underrepresented types + API reporting of coverage gaps. Sample-size-aware (n=300 misses far more tracts than n=10000).

- [ ] **TODO-POLL-3: House Effects as Type Signal** — Persistent house effects may reflect which types a pollster systematically reaches, not pollster bias. Trafalgar's R-lean may mean they reach rural evangelical types others miss. Future work: decompose house effects into type-reach profiles per pollster. Requires TODO-POLL-1 data to validate. Risk: double-counting if we both correct dem_share AND infer type composition from house effects. Resolution: replace house effect correction with type-reach inference once validated.

- [ ] **TODO-MODEL-GA: State Prediction Tuning** — The forecast engine's county reconstruction (`type_scores @ theta`) can diverge from Ridge county priors (e.g., GA: Ridge R+2.1 vs engine D+10.4). This is a known consequence of type-level estimation projecting back to county level. Not a bug per se — the engine's hierarchical decomposition is the intended architecture — but predictions need validation against county-level ground truth. Tune λ/μ regularization and validate state-level aggregates against historical results.
