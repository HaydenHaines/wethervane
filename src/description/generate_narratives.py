"""Auto-generate 2-3 sentence human-readable descriptions for each type.

Uses z-score profiles computed from type_profiles.parquet and mean prediction
data to produce template-based narratives without LLM calls.  Output style:
538-audience, accessible language, no raw z-score numbers exposed.

Narrative structure (3 sentences):
  1. Geography/setting overview (urbanicity, income, county count)
  2. Most distinctive demographic features (top 3 by |z-score|)
  3. Political lean + trend signal (from mean predicted Dem share + shifts)
