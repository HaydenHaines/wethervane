"""Voter behavior layer: per-type turnout ratio (τ) and residual choice shift (δ).

Decomposes the difference between presidential and off-cycle elections into:
  τ (turnout ratio): off-cycle / presidential total votes per type
  δ (residual choice shift): off-cycle Dem share minus presidential Dem share per type

Input data (T.1/T.3 pipeline outputs):
  tract_elections.parquet  — columns: tract_geoid, year, race_type, total_votes, dem_share
  tract_type_assignments.parquet — columns: tract_geoid, type_0_score..type_99_score, dominant_type

The race_type codes used here are:
  PRES                 → presidential (high-turnout baseline)
  GOV                  → governor (off-cycle)
  SEN/SEN_SPEC/SEN_ROFF/SEN_SPECROFF → Senate (off-cycle)
All other race_types (CONG, AG, LTG, etc.) are ignored because they don't provide
the consistent two-party presidential-vs-offcycle comparison needed for τ and δ.
