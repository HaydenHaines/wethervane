"""
Build county-to-congressional-district crosswalk from Census Block Assignment Files.

Strategy:
  1. Download Census BAF2020 _CD.txt files (block → district mapping)
  2. Join with DRA block-level election data (block → vote totals)
  3. Aggregate to county-district pairs weighted by 2024 presidential votes

The BAF2020 files map 2020 Census blocks to post-redistricting congressional
districts (118th/119th Congress, effective 2023-2027). The DRA block data uses
the same 2020 Census block geography, so GEOIDs join directly.

Output: data/districts/county_district_crosswalk.parquet
  - county_fips: str, 5-digit FIPS code
  - state_fips: str, 2-digit state FIPS
  - district_id: str, format "SS-DD" (e.g., "01-07" for AL-7)
  - overlap_votes: int, total 2024 presidential votes in the county-district intersection
  - overlap_fraction: float, fraction of county's votes in this district (sums to 1.0 per county)

At-large states (AK, DE, MT, ND, SD, VT, WY) have a single district "SS-00"
with overlap_fraction=1.0 for all counties.
