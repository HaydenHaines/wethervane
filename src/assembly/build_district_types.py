"""
Build district-level type composition vectors from county type assignments.

For each congressional district, computes the type membership vector by
aggregating county memberships weighted by the county-district overlap fraction
from the crosswalk.

The key equation:
  W_district[j] = sum_i (overlap_fraction[i,d] * W_county[i,j])

where i indexes counties, d indexes districts, and j indexes types.

This enables the model to treat districts as linear combinations of types,
just like it does for counties -- but districts are defined by the crosswalk
mapping, not by direct type assignment.

Inputs:
  data/districts/county_district_crosswalk.parquet (from build_district_crosswalk)
  data/communities/type_assignments.parquet (county-level type scores)

Output: data/districts/district_type_compositions.parquet
  - district_id: str, format "SS-DD"
  - type_0 through type_99: float, soft membership scores (sum to 1.0 per district)
