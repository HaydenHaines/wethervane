"""Candidate registry: crosswalk identifying unique politicians across multiple races.

This is Phase 1 of the political sabermetrics pipeline. Its job is deceptively
simple: figure out that "Ron Johnson (Wisconsin, 2010)" and "Ron Johnson
(Wisconsin, 2016)" are the same person. Without this crosswalk, computing
cross-election career stats is impossible.

The challenge: the 538 checking-our-work CSVs are a flat list of
candidate-by-race rows with no persistent IDs. Two candidates with the same
name in different years might be the same person (Ron Johnson running twice)
or different people (two candidates named John Smith in different states).

Disambiguation strategy:
1. For legislators: fuzzy-match names against the unitedstates/congress-legislators
   YAML. These get bioguide IDs, the gold-standard unique key across
   Congress.gov, VoteView, GovTrack, etc.
2. For non-legislators (governors, challengers who never served in Congress):
   we can't use bioguide IDs. Instead we match by (state, party, rough name)
   across years. Collisions are extremely rare given state+party constraints.
3. Ambiguous cases are flagged with needs_review=True rather than silently
   merged or silently split.

The output is candidate_registry.json: one record per unique person, with all
their races and their bioguide ID when available.
