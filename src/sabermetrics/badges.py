"""Badge derivation for political candidates.

Badges translate CTOV vectors into human-readable archetypes. Each badge
reflects a demographic dimension: does this candidate systematically
over/underperform in communities dominated by a particular demographic trait?

Badge math:
    residual = career_ctov - party_mean_ctov
    effective = party_adjust(residual)  # negate for R
    score = dot(effective, demographic_feature_per_type)

Party-mean subtraction ensures badges capture what makes a candidate UNIQUE
within their party, not what makes them a generic D or R.  Without it, all
D candidates score similarly on education/income badges (because those are
party coalition patterns, not individual fingerprints).

The effective CTOV is then party-adjusted (flipped for R candidates so that
positive scores always mean overperformance in that demographic context).

A badge is awarded when |score| > 1 standard deviation above the
cross-candidate mean, ensuring badges are relative (not absolute) measures.

For multi-race candidates, badges use the average CTOV across their career,
not any single race — this is the career signal, not a one-year snapshot.

NOTE: Only badges use residual (party-relative) CTOV.  Phase 4 CTOV
prediction integration uses absolute CTOV — we want the full candidate
signal including party component for prediction priors.
