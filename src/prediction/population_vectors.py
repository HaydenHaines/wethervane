"""Vote-weighted population demographic vectors per state.

This module extracts the core population vector logic from the poll coverage
diagnostic so it can be shared with the forecast pipeline. The key operation
is: given the model's type profiles and county soft-membership scores, compute
the expected demographic composition of each state's electorate.

This is used by:
  1. ``scripts/analyze_poll_coverage.py`` — diagnostic for identifying coverage gaps.
  2. ``src/prediction/poll_enrichment.py`` — post-stratification correction that
     adjusts effective sample size when a poll oversamples a demographic group.

    """Compute vote-weighted population demographic vectors per state.

    For each state we compute: for each demographic group, the population share
    implied by the community type distribution. The steps are:

    1. For each county, the soft membership scores (type_0_score … type_99_score)
       describe how much of that county belongs to each of the J=100 types.
    2. The expected demographic share for county c is:
         demo(c) = sum_j [ scores(c,j) * type_demo(j) ]
    3. The state-level population vector is the vote-count-weighted average across
       counties in the state.

    This gives us the "ground truth" demographic composition of each state's
    electorate (from the model's perspective).

    Args:
        type_profiles: DataFrame with one row per type, demographic columns.
        county_assignments: DataFrame with county_fips and type_0_score … type_99_score.
        county_votes: DataFrame with county_fips, state_abbr, pres_total_2020.
        xt_cols: The xt_ column names for which to compute population vectors.
            Only columns present in XT_TO_TYPE_PROFILE_COL (and in type_profiles)
            will be included in the output.

    Returns:
