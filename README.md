# US Political Covariation Model

A political modeling platform that discovers electoral types directly from how counties shift across elections, estimates how those types covary using demographic profiles, and propagates polling signals through the covariance structure to produce county-level predictions. The key insight is that beneath the noise of individual elections lies a structural landscape of communities that move together politically -- communities that cross administrative boundaries, persist across decades, and can be discovered purely from spatially correlated electoral shifts.

## Core Hypothesis

Counties that shift similarly across elections -- regardless of geographic distance -- share underlying structural characteristics that make them covary politically. These "electoral types" can be discovered directly from shift vectors (log-odds changes in vote share across election pairs), and their covariance structure (constructed from demographic profiles) can propagate sparse polling information to produce county-level predictions.

This hypothesis is **falsifiable by design**: types are discovered from pre-2024 electoral shifts, then tested against held-out 2024 shifts. If types fail to predict the holdout, the model fails cleanly. Current holdout correlation: **r = 0.818** across 293 counties (J=43 types, T=10 soft membership).

## Architecture

The system is a nine-stage pipeline where types are discovered from electoral shifts, then described and connected via demographics:

```
Data Assembly --> Shift Vectors --> Type Discovery --> Hierarchical Nesting --> Type Description
   (Python)        (Python)         (Python/KMeans)     (Python/Ward HAC)       (Python)

--> Covariance Construction --> Poll Propagation --> Prediction --> Validation
        (Python)                   (Python)           (Python)      (Python)
```

**Stage 1 -- Data Assembly.** Ingest historical election returns (presidential 2000-2024, governor 2002-2022), decennial census (2000/2010/2020), ACS 2022, RCMS religious data, IRS migration flows. Output: county-level data for 293 FL+GA+AL counties.

**Stage 2 -- Shift Vector Computation.** Compute log-odds shift vectors for each county across all election pairs. Presidential shifts are weighted 2.5x (they correlate across state lines); governor/Senate shifts are state-centered (demeaned within each state) to capture within-state differentiation without isolating types by state.

**Stage 3 -- Type Discovery (KMeans J=43).** Cluster counties into J=43 electoral types using KMeans on the weighted, state-centered shift vectors (J selected via leave-one-pair-out CV). Types represent abstract archetypes of electoral behavior -- counties that shift similarly belong to the same type regardless of geography.

**Stage 4 -- Hierarchical Nesting.** Ward HAC on KMeans centroids (no spatial constraint) produces 6-8 super-types for public interpretability. Super-types are the "colors" of the stained glass map.

**Stage 5 -- Type Description.** Overlay time-matched demographics (interpolated decennial census), RCMS religious data, and IRS migration on discovered types. Types are named from their demographic character, not discovered from it.

**Stage 6 -- Covariance Construction.** Economist-inspired approach (Heidemanns/Gelman/Morris 2020): construct J x J type covariance from demographic profiles via Pearson correlation, shrunk toward all-1s (national swing prior), with PD enforcement. Deterministic Python, no sampling needed.

**Stage 7 -- Poll Propagation.** Gaussian Bayesian update distributes state-level poll signal to types via the covariance structure. Full MRP (R+Stan) deferred to post-MVP.

**Stage 8 -- Prediction.** Type-level estimates multiplied by county soft-membership weights (inverse-distance to KMeans centroids, row-normalized to sum to 1) produce county-level predictions. Dual output: vote share + turnout.

**Stage 9 -- Validation.** Holdout backtesting (train on pre-2024 shifts, test on 2024), type coherence analysis, and calibration diagnostics.

## Key Innovation: Dual Output

Most political prediction models estimate vote share only, treating turnout as exogenous or ignoring it. This model estimates vote share and turnout jointly through the same community covariance structure. This matters because turnout variation is one of the largest sources of prediction error in elections -- communities that shift in partisan preference often shift in participation simultaneously, and the two are driven by related social dynamics.

## Proof of Concept

The initial implementation covers **Florida, Georgia, and Alabama** (293 counties). This three-state region was chosen for its political diversity: major metro areas, rural counties, the Black Belt, retirement communities, college towns, military-adjacent communities, and Cuban-American enclaves. It is large enough to test the covariance structure meaningfully and small enough to iterate quickly.

### Primary gaps

- **Test coverage**: 1,338 tests covering assembly, discovery, covariance, propagation, API, contract validation, and frontend
- **Additional data sources**: RCMS 2020 religious data integrated (293 counties x 6 features). IRS migration edge list integrated (county-to-county flows, 2019-2022). Still pending: LODES commuting flows, Facebook SCI, FEC donor density
- **Real poll data**: `data/polls/polls_2026.csv` contains synthetic placeholder polls; real 2026 polls must replace these as the cycle advances
- **Full MRP**: R+Stan propagation pipeline is scaffolded but not implemented; Python Gaussian update is sufficient for the October 2026 target
- **Historical VEST expansion**: 2012/2014 VEST data would add election pairs for richer shift vectors
- **Sabermetrics**: all five sabermetrics source files contain only function signatures; no implemented logic yet

## Electoral Types (KMeans J=43)

KMeans clustering on presidential-weighted, state-centered shift vectors discovers 43 electoral types (J selected via leave-one-pair-out cross-validation over J=12..50). Each county receives temperature-scaled soft membership (T=10) via inverse-distance to KMeans centroids. Types nest into 5 super-types via Ward HAC for public interpretability.

### Super-types

| Super-type | Counties | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| Southern Rural Conservative | 36 | Deep rural AL/GA/FL |
| Rural & Small-Town Mixed | 87 | Small towns, mixed demographics |
| Suburban Professional | 87 | Metro suburbs, higher income/education |
| Black Belt & Diverse | 41 | Majority-Black counties, historical plantation belt |
| Florida Coastal & Hispanic | 42 | South FL, Hispanic enclaves, coastal communities |

Key discovery: presidential shifts at 2.5x weight enable cross-state correlation while state-centered governor/Senate shifts provide within-state differentiation. J=43 was the CV-optimal type count (plateau at ~43, extending to J=50 showed no further gain).

## Validation Results

Types are discovered from pre-2024 shift vectors, then validated against held-out 2024 presidential shifts:

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Holdout Pearson r | 0.818 | Train on pre-2024 shifts, predict 2024 pres D-share shift |
| Calibration MAE | 0.061 | With T=10 soft membership |
| Type count (J) | 43 | Selected via leave-one-pair-out CV (J=12..50) |
| Super-types | 5 | Ward HAC on centroids for public interpretability |

### Historical approaches (retained for comparison)

| Approach | Holdout metric | Notes |
|----------|---------------|-------|
| KMeans J=43 (current) | r=0.818 | Presidential x2.5 + state-centered governor, T=10 |
| KMeans J=20 (prior) | r=0.778 | Same features, fewer types |
| HAC K=10 geographic blobs | r=0.903 | High autocorrelation but "alternative states" not types |
| NMF K=7 on demographics | R²=0.661 | Indirect: demographics -> political validation |
